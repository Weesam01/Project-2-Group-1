# Project-2-Group-1

## Summary:
The prepared application is based on Neural Network training models, Time Series Analysis and results from Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning models.

### Usage Purposes:
The application is prepared and trained on financial dataset that is a cut down version of a larger dataset file. There are six analysis file. One based off on cutting down the dastaset. Two for Time Series analysis that analysis predicting pattern according to the time intervals patterns of events. Another one is a Neural Network model that trains and tests the original datset and finally supervised and unsupervised learning models that does Clustering, PCA and ICA Analysis and Logistical Regresion models and outputs various meaningful results.
